##This is the GUI for CIGALE. 

_Using the customtkinter and tkinter package._
To use this application,  
Please predownload cigale, and run 
`pcigale -h`
in the terminal to see that the download works all right.

Then, run the GUI_CL.py file, and select your folder path and (anaconda/conda) activation command with the buttons shown on the UI.  
E.G.  
```FOLDER_PATH = C:/Users/AstroLover/CIGALE/NGC5813```  
```ANACONDA_CMD = C:/Users/AstroLover/anaconda3/Scripts/activate.bat C:/Users/AstroLover/anaconda3/envs/py3```  
There is no need to change the anaconda/conda activation command once you select a workable one. The input button is named '(ana)conda activation'. However, the folder path should be selected every time you open a new folder. The button is named 'Add Folder...'

More specific information will come out later. Star to support the creator of these contents!
